= 50 c projects to do in order from easy to hard
== make a seperate folder for each

- [x] Find the largest of three numbers  
- [x] Print multiplication table of a given number  
- [x] Print Fibonacci sequence up to n terms  
- [x] Check if a number is prime

- [ ] Set, clear, toggle nth bit of a number  
- [ ] Check if a number is power of 2 using bitwise operators  
- [ ] Dynamic memory: allocate array at runtime, resize it  
- [ ] Dynamic 2D matrix addition and multiplication  
- [ ] Implement string functions using dynamic memory (dynamic strcat, etc.)

- [ ] Linked list: insert at beginning, delete node, reverse list  
- [ ] Stack implementation using array and using linked list  
- [ ] Queue implementation using array (circular queue) and linked list  
- [ ] Simple phonebook using structures + file handling (add, search, delete, display all) – full menu-driven program  

once this is done then real projects
